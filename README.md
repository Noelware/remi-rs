**remi-rs** is a Rust edition of Noelware's Java library [remi](https://github.com/Noelware/remi) that was discontinuted on **December 15th, 2023** and is the primary library that Noelware uses and maintained.

**remi-rs** is a easy way to communicate with object storage providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon S3. It is an abstraction on common methods (like fetching, creating, listing, etc.) called a "storage service" where it implements a set of methods that is commonly used in applications.
