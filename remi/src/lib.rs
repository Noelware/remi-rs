//! **remi-rs** is a Rust edition of Noelware's Java library [remi](https://github.com/Noelware/remi) that was
//! discontinuted on **December 15th, 2023** and is the primary library that Noelware uses and maintained.
//!
//! **remi-rs** is a easy way to communicate with object storage providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon S3.
//! It is an abstraction on common methods (like fetching, creating, listing, etc.) called a "storage service"
//! where it implements a set of methods that is commonly used in applications.
//!
//! **Warning** ‚Äî All code in the repository is VERY EXPERIMENTAL and things can break at anytime &
//! be removed without any notice.
//!
//! ## Projects using `remi-rs`
