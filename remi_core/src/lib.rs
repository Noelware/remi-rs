//! **remi_core** is the base API implementation that is used by the remi_* crates available to you. This should be only
//! included in your project if you are creating your own implementation of the [`StorageService`] trait.
//!
//! ## Example
//! ```no_run
//! use emi_core::{StorageService, EmptyConfig};
//! use async_trait::async_trait;
//!
//! struct MyStorageService;
//!
//! #[async_trait]
//! impl StorageService<EmptyConfig> for MyStorageService {
//!     /* omitted details */
//! }
//! ```
