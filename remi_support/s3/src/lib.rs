//! # üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏èüß∂ Amazon S3 support for remi-rs
//! **remi-s3** implements the [remi-core](https://github.com/Noelware/remi-rs/tree/master/remi_core) crate that interacts
//! with any Amazon S3 compatible server.
//!
//! > Note: This crate is also re-exported in the main [remi](https://crates.io/crates/remi) crate with the `s3` feature.
//!
//! ## Features
//! ### serde (disabled by default)
//! Enabels the use of **serde** for the [`S3StorageConfig`] struct.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! # Using the main `remi` crate. This is recommended for most cases, but not recommended
//! # if you want to enable some crate features.
//! remi = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["s3"] }
//!
//! # Using the crate itself, which you can enable any feature you wish. You will need to write
//! # the following examples as `remi_s3` instead of `remi::s3`.
//! remi-s3 = "0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use remi::core::StorageService;
//! use remi::s3::S3StorageService;
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let s3 = S3StorageService::from_aws_env();
//! s3.init().await?;
//! # }
//! ```

mod config;
mod service;

pub use config::{S3StorageConfig, S3StorageConfigBuilder, S3StorageConfigBuilderError};
pub use service::S3StorageService;
